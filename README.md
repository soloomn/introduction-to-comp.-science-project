1) We conducted a study of two modern popular programming languages in order to evaluate the prospects for their further study. We used the LaTeX markup language (an extension of the original TeX created by Donald Knuth) as a computer layout system. Its library "beamer" was used to create the presentation. So far the project is only available in Russian, but I will soon do a full translation into English. 
2) If you want to run ".tex" file you need to install TeX language on your computer (I recommend to use TeX live utility). After installation you need an IDE for editing and easy compilation of the code. You can install the appropriate extensions for your MS Visual Studio Code or use a utility like TeX Studio.
3) If you don't want to install the language and IDE on your computer, just open the file "main-LaTeX.pdf", it represents the already compiled final version of the project in Russian, soon there will be a special English version of the files "main.tex" and "main-LaTeX.pdf"
